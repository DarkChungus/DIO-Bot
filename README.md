  <h1><b>🤖DIO Discord Bot🤖</b></h1>
  <p>
    <b><i>DIO</i></b> is a discord bot that I made, to get a feel of how discord bots are made again. I made a few other discord bots before, but it wasn't really that big of a project,
    I probably only did a few greetings, and the "ping pong" feature(not to mention, it was made in JavaScript). This time, though, I want this project to be something I can dedicate a 
    lot of time to.<br>br>
